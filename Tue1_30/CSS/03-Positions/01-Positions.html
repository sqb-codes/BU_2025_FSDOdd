                    Ajit Agarkar was asked if the coronation of Shubman Gill as an all-format captain had already started. The question seemed rather bizarre with Suryakumar Yadav sitting right there, but then that seems the reality - or rather, the future reality of Indian cricket. The Gill era in Indian cricket seems to have well and truly begun, even if he is only the vice-captain at present in the Twenty20 format.

                    "We obviously see some leadership qualities in him, and his form in England was what we were hoping for. He obviously exceeded all our expectations. With the kind of form that he showed with his bat when there's so much pressure on you as a captain which is a great sign," the chairman of the selectors said, giving the youngster a resounding thumbs-up, after announcing India's squad for Asia Cup.
